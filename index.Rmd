# Preface {-}

This book covers using R for doing Operations Research. The current focus is on optimization. In the future it may grow to include a broader range of Operations Research methods. 

I would like to thank many people for their contributions, collaborations, and assistance over the years. All errors are my fault though.

Most of all, I would like to also express my appreciation for my family's patience while working on this book with many late nights:  Carrie, Trent, and Paige.
